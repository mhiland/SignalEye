## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please use GitHub’s Security Advisories feature:

1. Go to the repository’s "Security" tab.
2. Click on "Advisories" and select "Report a vulnerability."
3. Follow the prompts to submit your report privately to the maintainers.

- **Updates**: We’ll provide status updates, usually within 1-2 weeks.
- **Resolution**: We will notify you once a fix is planned or if the report is declined, with reasons provided.

Please wait until a fix is released before disclosing the issue publicly. Thank you for helping us improve security!
